<h4> What is Courier</h4>
  </section>
<section class= "Courier">
<hr>
<p>
Courier is a monospaced slab serif typeface designed to resemble the output from a strike-on typewriter. The typeface was designed by Howard "Bud" Kettler in 1955, and it was later redrawn by Adrian Frutiger for the IBM Selectric Composer series of electric typewriters.
<br>
As a monospaced font, in the 1990s, it found renewed use in the electronic world in situations where columns of characters must be consistently aligned. It has also become an industry standard for all screenplays to be written in 12-point Courier or a close variant. 12-point Courier New was also the U.S. State Department's standard typeface until January 2004, when it was replaced with 14-point Times New Roman. Reasons for the change included the desire for a more "modern" and "legible" font.

<h4> The Man  Behind The Font</h4>

<p>
Howard G. ("Bud") Kettler was a cartoonist for "The Crimson & Gold" school newspaper when he was a junior and senior in New Bremen High School.
<br>
In December 1947, Bud resigned his post-war job as postal clerk at the New Bremen Post Office and effective 1/1/1948, he took over management of The Home Printing Company, publishers of "The New Bremen Sun". He became the business manager of the job printing plant and also of The Sun.
<br>
On 7/15/1948, the name of the business was changed to The Sun Printing Co. On 9/15/1949, Bud himself was listed as Editor of the paper. Bud built a new concrete block building at the corner of 1st & Walnut Streets, where he conducted the printing business from 9/21/1950 until 10/1/1952 when he sold the business to L.T. Stanley of Cincinnati.
<br>
When Bud Kettler sold the Sun in October 1952, he accepted a position as type designer with IBM in Poughkeepsie, New York, having the type and font knowledge that IBM was looking for. In 1955, Bud designed the Courier type style for the type bar typewriter and later, when the IBM Selectric typewriter was created, Courier was adapted for the type ball used in this style typewriter. He also designed the Advocate type style for the Selectric. Of the many type styles Bud designed, he was most proud of designing the Braille font for the IBM Braille Writer, which embossed the paper so that a blind person could feel the typed image and read it. He traveled the world for IBM and also worked closely with the FBI and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police on confidential efforts.

<h4>The Type Writer</h4>
  </section>
  <section class= "Courier">
<hr>
<p>
The original Selectric Composer, announced in 1966, required text to be typed twice. On the first pass, the machine would automatically measure the length of the line, providing the operator with a color+number (i.e. green-2) combination to be noted in the right margin. When the operator finished all lines of the document, they would put a clean sheet of specially coated paper into the machine and engage the justification lever. This time, prior to typing each line of text, the operator would turn a color dial to the noted color, and another dial to the noted number. Once the dials were set, the operator would begin typing the text. While typing, the Composer would insert incremental amounts of additional space between words such that the line would always be flush on the right margin. Errors could not be corrected, and when they occurred, the operator would simply space down a few lines and retype the line. In those days, cut and paste literally meant cut and paste. The completed copy would be cut, removing any erroneous lines, and pasted onto a layout sheet for later processing.
