<header> Has Design Become to Hard? A Review</header>
<p>
Going through it I found it a rather <s>homur</s>humorous informal conversation on web design as a <strong>whole</strong>. I actually enjoyed it, <mark>HOWEVER</mark> I think that I should go back at a later date and actually go through his links and spend a grander amount of time to take in the info. I also like how it brings up links to things not many people would know walking into authoring, like <mark>Sass</mark>, <mark> Boostrap</mark> or other programs. Overall it was a quick and enjoyable read, but I feel that I need to spend more time with it overall to further grasp the information in it.

<header> QUOTES </header>
<p> In the early days of web design, beginning in 1995, pixels were not standardized between <abbr title="Personal Computer"> PC </abbr> and Macintosh; monitor aspect ratios were not standardized, period; and when we got a <strong> standardized layout language</strong> for the web, every browser supported it differently <i> for years</i>.</p>

<p>
<mark>Later, when standards were better supported in browsers, some of us pretended that “everybody” had a 600 x 400 monitor (and then an <code> 800 x 600 </code>, and then <code> 1024 x 768 </code>), but these too were consensual hallucinations. And even in those rose-colored fixed-width days, there was always a client or a QA tester whose user preference settings, outdated <u>browser</u>, or wonky operating system blew our carefully constructed fixed-width layouts to hell.</mark>
