  <p>Woah, hey! I'm Brian White! As you could read from the beginning of my website I am indeed an animator and enjoy funny jokes. I tend to work in traditional stopmotion work where I'm allowed to play with the form in real space. My love of the medium started while in an experimental animation class where I was allowed to mess around with the craft. Then, I was sold, day one. But don't be fooled, I still enjoy doodling illustrations and other things. I have been invited to charity auctions to do illustrations, which was a blast. I also spent a matter of months creating digital media, such as websites and CSS art and animations. I hope you go through this short website and have fun with it.</p>

There are a few words that rhyme with firetruck and bass, I may be forgetting some. BUT ANYWAY be careful there.
